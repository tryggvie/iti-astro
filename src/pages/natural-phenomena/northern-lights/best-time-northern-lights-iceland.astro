        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Introduction</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          You see the Northern Lights in Iceland when three things align: <strong>darkness</strong>, <strong>clear skies</strong>, 
          and <strong>geomagnetic activity</strong>. Practically, that means travelling between late August and mid/late April, 
          with the highest odds from September to March when nights are long.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Within a night, activity most often peaks around local midnight, roughly 22:00–02:00. Equinox periods feel productive 
          because both darkness and geomagnetic activity often cooperate.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Use Iceland's Met Office map to pair aurora activity with cloud-cover gaps and check sun and moon times for Reykjavík 
          to avoid bright moonlight when possible. We are also near the peak of Solar Cycle 25, which can increase the frequency 
          of strong displays, though clouds still decide any given evening.

        <div class="space-y-4">
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            <strong>The best months are September to March</strong>, when nights are reliably long and full darkness returns across Iceland. 
            August's end and April's first half can still work, but shorter nights compress opportunities and require clearer weather 
            or stronger activity.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            <strong>Aim for at least three nights</strong> to sample different cloud patterns and activity bursts, and keep evenings 
            flexible for short-notice drives to clearer skies.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Within a night, your prime window is around local midnight—roughly 22:00–02:00—with the active hours expanding during 
            stronger geomagnetic events. Plan to be set up before 22:00, then stay patient.

            <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">September</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700">
              Darkness returns quickly and temperatures are milder than mid-winter. Atlantic weather is changeable, but longer dark 
              evenings make short trips viable again. Expect more "photographic" greens with occasional pillars when activity rises, 
              particularly toward the autumn equinox.

            <p class="text-gray-700">
              Nights are long, and the odds of gaps between fronts are decent. Wind, rain, and early snow are common, so plan wider 
              nightly search areas and watch cloud animations closely. The longer darkness offsets unsettled weather.
            </p>

            <p class="text-gray-700">
              Maximum darkness offers the broadest observing hours, but storm frequency and road conditions demand flexibility. 
              Prioritise safe, known pull-outs over remote tracks. The payoff is frequent clear breaks behind fronts and vivid 
              overhead curtains during strong events.

            <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">February–March</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700">
              Stable high-pressure spells are more common, producing crisp, clear nights. The spring equinox often coincides with 
              enhanced geomagnetic activity, while darkness still lasts long enough for extended vigils. Late winter is a sweet spot 
              for first-timers.

            <p class="text-gray-700">
              Nights shorten rapidly, so aim for late-evening setups and chase strong activity. You can still catch excellent shows, 
              especially during geomagnetic storms that push the oval equatorward, but cloud timing and moon phase matter more.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Why Solar Cycle 25 Matters Now</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Solar Cycle 25 is at or near its maximum through roughly 2024–2026, which raises the frequency of geomagnetic storms 
          capable of producing bright, dynamic aurora over Iceland. That increases your chances over a multi-night trip, but it 
          does not override local weather or daylight constraints.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Big storms can also expand the auroral oval toward lower latitudes, which is why intense events sometimes produce sightings 
          far south in Europe and North America. In Iceland, such storms translate to longer active windows and more overhead curtains, 
          visible even with some moonlight or thin cloud.

            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3">
              Start with Vedur's aurora page, which overlays an aurora activity index (0–9) with detailed cloud-cover maps and 
              Reykjavík sun and moon times. Slide across the hours to find likely clear gaps, then match that with your driving 
              radius and safe pull-outs.

            <strong>Three to five nights markedly increase your odds</strong>, because you can play both weather and space weather. 
            Base yourself outside bright city cores where practical, or choose accommodation with dark surroundings to reduce setup time.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Pack a simple plan: check Vedur for clouds each afternoon, check NOAA's Viewline/Kp trend in the evening, and pre-select 
            two safe, dark locations upwind of cloud. Head out by 21:30, give each spot at least 30–45 minutes, and pivot if new gaps emerge.
